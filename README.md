[MCP Center](https://aka.ms/mcp-center) serves as a showcase illustrating how Azure customers can build their own **enterprise-ready MCP registry**. It's important to understand that this is **not a public registry**; rather, it's a curated collection of MCP servers designed to inspire and guide our customers.
