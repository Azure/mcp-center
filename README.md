# Welcome to MCP Center

MCP Center serves as a demonstration for our Azure customers, illustrating how to build their own **enterprise-ready MCP registry**. It's important to understand that this is **not a public registry**; rather, it's a curated collection of MCP servers designed to inspire and guide our customers.

## Powered by Azure API Center

MCP Center leverages the capabilities of **Azure API Center**, a private enterprise MCP registry. Azure API Center provides a centralized hub to catalog, manage, and share your organization's and third-party MCP servers within your company. It's a powerful tool for **MCP server governance, discovery, and reuse**.

> **Good news!** Azure API Center can be created for **free** in any Azure subscription. You can find the official documentation and learn more about its capabilities here: [Azure API Center documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-center/set-up-api-center)


## Your Opportunity: Onboarding to the Azure MCP Ecosystem

Every Azure API Center service includes an **MCP Discovery Page**. This page showcases remote MCP parter servers and offers a direct opportunity to register them into your own MCP registry (with or without placing them behind an [AI Gateway/API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/genai-gateway-capabilities)).

We want to give partners the opportunity to become a part of the Azure MCP ecosystem. By showcasing your remote MCP servers, you can significantly:

- **Boost Visibility & Adoption**: Get your MCP servers in front of a broad audience of Azure customers, increasing their discoverability and potential for adoption.
- **Streamline Governance & Compliance**: By being part of a centralized registry, your MCP servers can be more easily governed and managed, ensuring they meet internal security and compliance standards for organizations.
- **Lead the AI Revolution**: Position your organization at the forefront of AI innovation by having your MCP servers featured within Azure's rapidly evolving AI ecosystem.

> Note: Azure API Center will support the Azure AI Foundry tool catalog. This means partners will have the ability to further enrich their reach by partnering not just with Azure API Center, but also with Azure AI Foundry moving forward.
