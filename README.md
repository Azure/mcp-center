# Welcome to MCP Center <img src="media/apic-icon.svg" alt="Azure API Center" height="32" style="vertical-align: middle;">

[MCP Center](https://aka.ms/mcp-center) serves as a demonstration for our Azure customers, illustrating how to build their own **enterprise-ready MCP registry**. It's important to understand that this is **not a public registry**; rather, it's a curated collection of MCP servers designed to inspire and guide our customers.
